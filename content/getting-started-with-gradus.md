```
<br>

#### Following files can be modified to make Gradus truly yours:

1. **Project Meta Information:** Navigate to `assets/config.js` to customize your codelab’s metadata, such as the project name, description, and social media links, along with SEO and AI-related settings.
2. **Images:** Upload thumbnail images and favicon to the `public` directory.



# Configuration

Customize your project to suit your needs with the following configuration options:

## Google Analytics Integration

To add Google Analytics to your project:

- **File Location:** Open the `nuxt.config.ts` file.
- **Configuration:** Insert your Google Analytics tracking code here to start monitoring your application's traffic.

```ts[nuxt.config.ts]
gtag: {
  id: "G-your-tag"
}
```

## Banner Management

Manage the display banner easily:

- **File Location:** Navigate to the `config.js` file.
- **Toggle Banner:** You can easily enable or disable the banner. Additionally, you can modify the content of the banner directly within this file.

## Enabling AI Features

To leverage AI functionalities within your project:

- **Configuration Steps:**

  1. Go to the `config.js` file.
  2. Set `aiFlag` to `true` to enable AI features.
  3. Adjust `aiFlagType` to specify the type of AI you want to activate ([openai](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) or [gemini](https://aistudio.google.com/)).
  4. Create a `.env` file in the project root to securely store API keys.

- **Environment File Setup:** Provide your API keys in the `.env` file as follows:

  ```
  OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR-API-KEY"
  GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR-API-KEY"
  ```

# Create Your First Codelab

Start by creating a new codelab using Markdown. This will guide you through setting up your first interactive tutorial.

## Step 1: Create a Markdown File

- **Location:** Place your new Markdown file inside the `/content` folder.
- **Example:** Name the file `hello-world.md`.

## Step 2: Define Metadata for the Codelab

Metadata plays a vital role not only in informing users about your codelab but also in configuring how it interacts with the system’s user interface and functionalities:

- **Purpose:** Metadata sets up the codelab's user interface and enables crucial functionalities like search and filtering. It ensures that the codelab is properly categorized and accessible, enhancing user engagement and organization.
- **Syntax:** Insert the following JavaScript object at the top of your Markdown file to include metadata:

```js

title: "Share Your Thought with Firebase";
description: "This Codelab demonstrates the use of Firebase for web developers.";
slug: "share-your-thought-with-firebase";
authors: [
  {
    name: "Abhinav Verma",
    image: "/authors/abhinav.png",
    socials: {
      linkedin: "https://linkedin.com/in/abhinavv9",
      github: "",
      twitter: "",
      web: "",
    },
  },
];
date: 2024 - 04 - 28;
categories: "Setup";
image: "/codelabs/getting-started-with-gradus/hero.png";
tags: ["GRADUS"];
draft: false;
---
```


- **Details Explained:**
  - `title`: The name of your codelab.
  - `description`: A brief summary of what the codelab is about.
  - `slug`: A URL-friendly version of the title for navigation.
  - `authors`: Details about the author(s), including social media links.
  - `date`: The publication date.
  - `categories`: The category under which the codelab falls.
  - `image`: A path to an image file related to the codelab.
  - `tags`: Keywords associated with the codelab to help in search and organization.
  - `draft`: A boolean indicating if the codelab is a draft or ready for publication.

## Step 3: Define the Structure of Your Codelab

Organize your codelab content using H1 tags to define major sections. **Each H1 tag will automatically start a new step** in the codelab, making it easy to follow.

```md
# Introduction

Introduce the goals and background of your codelab here.

# Resources

List resources or additional reading materials here.
```

## Important Note on Tags

<br>

:::md-alert{type="error"}
#content
Make sure to add tags in `/assets/config.js` file (case sensitive) for the filtering to work correctly in your codelab.
:::

# Markdown Components

We currently support specific custom components in markdown such as `md-alert` and `md-button`.

## Using Markdown Components

To incorporate markdown components into your document, use the custom component syntax `:::<md-component>:::`.

### Alert

For adding an alert message:

```md
:::md-alert
#content
This is an alert
:::
```
:::md-alert
#content
This is an alert
:::

#### Customization

Customizing these components allows you to tailor their appearance and behavior to better fit your content's needs.

- **Customize `md-alert`**
  - **Purpose:** Modify the appearance and information of alert boxes.
  - **Properties:**
    - `type`: Specifies the style of the alert (e.g., success, error).

 <br>

- **Example:**



```md
:::md-alert{type="success" }
#title
This is the title
#content
This is the content
:::
```

:::md-alert{type="success"}

#title
This is titile

#content
This is content

:::

<br>



<br>

### Button

For adding a button.
- **Customize `md-button`**
- **Purpose:** Adjust the look and functionality of buttons.
- **Properties:**
  - **type:** Defines the button style (e.g., outline, tonal, plain).
  - **color:** Sets the button color (e.g., primary, secondary).
  - **text:** Specifies the text displayed on the button.

```md
:::md-button{type="tonal" color="primary" link="https://trygradus.web.app/"}
Click me!
:::
```


:::md-button{type="tonal" color="primary" link="https://trygradus.web.app/"}
Click me!

# Deployment

This codelab can be deployed using one of two methods, each suited to different hosting environments and use cases.

## Server Side Rendering (SSR)

Server Side Rendering (SSR) enhances SEO and improves performance for users by serving pre-rendered pages from the server.

- **How to Generate Server-Side Code:**
  - Run the command `npm run build` in your project directory. This builds the application and prepares it for deployment.
- **Hosting Options:**

  - **Netlify:** Follow Netlify’s documentation to deploy your SSR application.
  - **Vercel:** Use Vercel for advanced server-side rendering capabilities. Both platforms support automatic deployment from your git repository.

  <br>

:::md-alert{type="error"}
#content
**Note on AI Features:** Currently, AI features are only supported in SSR deployments.
:::

## Static Site Generation (SSG)

Static Site Generation (SSG) offers fast loading times and reliable performance by generating HTML files at build time, which can be hosted on any static hosting service.

- **How to Generate Static Code:**
  - Execute the command `npx nuxi generate`. This command will produce a fully static version of your site, which can be deployed without needing a server.
- **Hosting Options:**
  - **Firebase:** Ideal for hosting static files with benefits like integrated security features and easy scaling.
  - **GitHub Pages:** A straightforward option for hosting static websites, especially if your project is already managed in a GitHub repository.

<br>

Choose the deployment method that best fits your project needs and the expected traffic. SSR is generally better for dynamic sites with heavy user interaction, while SSG is excellent for sites with fewer updates and high performance requirements.
